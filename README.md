Reactive Environment for Mixing and Composition (REMC)
===============================

Thank you for downloading our Reactive Environment for Mixing and Composition!

What is it?
-------------

The Reactive Environment for Mixing and Composition is an open-source solution that allows you to play, mix and record an instrument in real-time using a variety of effects, simply by moving your body.

Which platforms can I use this on?
----------------------------------

At the moment, our installation instructions are designed for Linux systems. The SuperCollider code, however, should work on other platforms such as OS X and Windows, provided that all the dependencies (or their equivalents) are correctly installed.


How do I install it?
---------------------

There are two ways to install our code, each documented separately:

1. 'Step by Step Installation Instructions.pdf' is optimal for Linux users who may already have some of our dependencies installed (see the full list below). It is designed to help them pick and choose which installation steps they would like to perform.

2. 'Automatic Installation Instructions.pdf' is optimal for Linux users working with a fresh installation. It provides guidelines for using a script that installs all dependencies automatically. Note: if you have already installed some of our dependencies in the past (see the full list below), this script may override some of your existing configurations. Therefore, we recommend following 'Step by Step Installation Instructions.pdf' instead.

Which dependencies will I need?
-------------------------------

Here is a list of packages required to run our Reactive Environment for NMP:
- linux-lowlatency
- jackd, qjackctl, libjack-dev
- Ardour
- jmess (requires: libasound2-dev, g++, qt4-dev-tools)
- supercollider, supercollider-gedit, supercollider-dev, libsclang1
- java-8-oracle (or equivalent Java Runtime Environment, such as openjdk-6-jre or openjdk-7-jre)
- SwingOSC
- OpenNI (requires: git, freeglut3-dev, libusb-1.0-0-dev, doxygen, graphviz)

How do I use it?
----------------

Please a look at 'User Manual.pdf' to get started!
